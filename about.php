<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
<p>A library at its best is the heartbeat of the school, the nucleus, the focus.  This statement is the foundation for and driving force behind the vision and plan of the school
 librarian â€” the understanding of the essential nature of the library program to student achievement and success. </p>
<p>Developing a program and facility that shapes this vision requires insight into several key components: education and support of students, training and support of faculty, cooperation and 
communication with administration, management of the library facility and staff, community outreach and advocacy, and continued personal professional growth.</p>

<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p> The Library Manaement System is generated in order to reduce the manual overhead in maintaining the library and to facilitate things for the users. </p>
<p> Using the software, we ensure the students and the teachers do not face any hurdles in the process.</p>
